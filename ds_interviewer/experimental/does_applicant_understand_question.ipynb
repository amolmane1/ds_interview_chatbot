    "Correct explation: A lasso model is a type of regularization technique that helps to reduce model complexity and mitigate overfitting. It does this by introducing a penalty term to the cost function of the model, which penalizes the magnitude of the coefficients of the predictors in the model. This encourages the model to only include the most important predictors and reduces the complexity of the model. The result is a more accurate and reliable model.\n",

    "Question: How does a random forest model work?\n",
    "Applicant's response: I don’t understand the question, could you rephrase the question?\n",
    "Correct response: A random forest model is an ensemble machine learning algorithm that is used for classification, regression, and other tasks. It works by constructing a multitude of decision trees from randomly selected subsets of the data and then combining their individual predictions to form a final prediction. The random forest model uses bagging and random feature selection to create the decision trees, and then aggregates the predictions of each tree to determine the final prediction. This makes the model robust and resilient to outliers, as the predictions of any one single tree can be offset by the other trees in the forest. It is also resistant to overfitting, as each tree only has access to a subset of the data, which prevents it from overfitting on the training data.Is Amol's explanation vague: False\n",

    "Correct response: A lasso model is a type of regularization technique that helps to reduce model complexity and mitigate overfitting. It does this by introducing a penalty term to the cost function of the model, which penalizes the magnitude of the coefficients of the predictors in the model. This encourages the model to only include the most important predictors and reduces the complexity of the model. The result is a more accurate and reliable model.\n",
