Applicant's explanation: With forward selection, you start with a model with zero features and add the feature which has the best score. The score is chosen beforehand, like the p value of a t test.

What Applicant used: one-hot encoding
Applicant's explanation: One-hot encoding converts each unique categorical value to a number.
Correct explation: One-hot encoding converts each unique categorical value to a binary vector.
Validation of explanation: incorrect

Problem: algorithm selection
What Applicant used: random forest
Applicant's explanation: random forest is a tree-based ensemble model. Multiple decision trees are fit on the data. At each decision stump, a random subset of features and observations is used. By doing so, the model learns to not overfit to features and observations. The final model output is the mode of the decision trees for classification tasks, and the mean of the decision trees for regression tasks. 
Correct explation: A random forest model is an ensemble machine learning algorithm that is used for classification, regression, and other tasks. It works by constructing a multitude of decision trees from randomly selected subsets of the data and then combining their individual predictions to form a final prediction. The random forest model uses bagging and random feature selection to create the decision trees, and then aggregates the predictions of each tree to determine the final prediction. This makes the model robust and resilient to outliers, as the predictions of any one single tree can be offset by the other trees in the forest. It is also resistant to overfitting, as each tree only has access to a subset of the data, which prevents it from overfitting on the training data.
Validation of explanation: correct

Problem: algorithm selection
What Applicant used: random forest
Applicant's explanation: random forest is a neural network where model accuracy is optimized using backpropagation.

Correct explation: A lasso model is a type of regularization technique that helps to reduce model complexity and mitigate overfitting. It does this by introducing a penalty term to the cost function of the model, which penalizes the magnitude of the coefficients of the predictors in the model.
