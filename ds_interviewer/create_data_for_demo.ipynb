    "raw_data = \"\"\"1) Imagine you are given 1 terabyte of data containing random integers. How would you sort this data, given that it cannot fit into the memory of a single machine?\n",
    "   - Correct: We could use an external sorting algorithm like the merge sort. We divide the data into smaller chunks that fit into memory, sort these chunks individually, then merge them.\n",
    "   - Correct: Implement a distributed sorting algorithm like MapReduce's sort and shuffle phase. Each worker node sorts its chunk of data and the results are merged.\n",
    "   - Incorrect: We can load the entire dataset into memory and use a quicksort algorithm to sort it.\n",
    "   - Incorrect: Just divide the data into smaller chunks, sort them individually, and concatenate them all at the end.\n",
    "2) How would you design a globally distributed key-value store? What would be your considerations to handle consistency, availability, and partition tolerance?\n",
    "   - Correct: A consideration would be to use data replication and partitioning, ensuring data is available in multiple regions. We also need to handle CAP theorem trade-offs.\n",
    "   - Correct: We could use a combination of techniques like consistent hashing, vector clocks for conflict resolution, and quorum consensus for read and write operations.\n",
    "   - Incorrect: Store all data in a single location to ensure consistency. If any site fails, all other sites would be updated to prevent access.\n",
    "   - Incorrect: Ignore consistency, as modern networks are reliable. Data replication isn't needed; we just need a good load balancer.\n",
    "3) Can you explain how you would scale a web application to handle a sudden increase in traffic?\n",
    "   - Correct: We can use horizontal scaling by adding more servers and implementing a load balancer.\n",
    "   - Correct: Implement caching, use a CDN for static resources, and optimize the database for better performance.\n",
    "   - Incorrect: Just buy more powerful (expensive) servers when the traffic increases.\n",
    "   - Incorrect: Remove some features of the application to decrease the load on the server.\n",
    "4) Can you explain how you would synchronize two threads that need to access a shared resource?\n",
    "   - Correct: We can use mutex locks or semaphores to ensure that only one thread can access the resource at a time.\n",
    "   - Correct: Implement a monitor, a synchronization mechanism that allows threads to have mutually exclusive access to shared resources.\n",
    "   - Incorrect: No synchronization is needed if the threads are running on different cores.\n",
    "   - Incorrect: Let both threads access the resource simultaneously. The one that finishes last will overwrite the results of the other.\n",
    "5) Can you explain how a hash table works and where it might be more useful than a tree or a graph?\n",
    "   - Correct: A hash table uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets. It's useful when we want O(1) average time complexity for search, insert, and delete operations.\n",
    "   - Correct: In a hash table, keys are unique. It’s particularly useful for tasks like counting the frequency of words in a document.\n",
    "   - Incorrect: A hash table has O(n) time complexity for search, insert, and delete operations.\n",
    "   - Incorrect: Hash tables are better than trees or graphs for traversing relationships between data.\n",
    "6) Can you design an API rate limiter? What considerations would you take into account for scalability, security, and performance?\n",
    "   - Correct: We can implement a token bucket or leaky bucket algorithm. We also need to consider distributed nature and should account for the system clock skew.\n",
    "   - Correct: Use a sliding log or sliding window algorithm to limit the requests. Use a centralized datastore like Redis for consistency in a distributed environment.\n",
    "   - Incorrect: We should block the user's IP address if they send too many requests.\n",
    "   - Incorrect: We don't need an API rate limiter; instead, we should focus on increasing the capacity of our server.\n",
    "7) What is the difference between a stack and a queue, and can you provide an example of where each might be used?\n",
    "   - Correct: A stack is a LIFO structure (last-in, first-out), useful for things like function call stacks. A queue is a FIFO structure (first-in, first-out), like a line of people waiting for a bus.\n",
    "   - Correct: A stack could be used for checking balanced symbols. Queues are used in scenarios like CPU scheduling or when implementing a cache.\n",
    "   - Incorrect: Stacks and queues are the same, the difference is only in the name.\n",
    "   - Incorrect: Stacks use a FIFO approach, good for print spooling. Queues use a LIFO approach, used in recursion algorithms.\n",
    "8) Can you explain how quicksort works? What is its time complexity and when would you use it?\n",
    "   - Correct: Quicksort is a divide and conquer algorithm. It works by selecting a 'pivot' element and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. The average time complexity is O(n log n).\n",
    "   - Correct: Quicksort performs well on a large dataset and is often faster in practice than other O(n log n) algorithms. However, in the worst-case scenario (already sorted or reverse sorted array), its time complexity is O(n^2).\n",
    "   - Incorrect: Quicksort is a stable sorting algorithm and works best on already sorted data.\n",
    "   - Incorrect: Quicksort time complexity in the worst case is O(n log n) and it can be used when we need to maintain the order of equal elements.\n",
    "9) Can you explain the concept of inheritance and provide an example?\n",
    "   - Correct: Inheritance is a principle in object-oriented programming where a class (child or derived class) derives the properties and behavior (methods) from another class (parent or base class). An example might be a `Car` class inheriting from a more general `Vehicle` class.\n",
    "   - Correct: Inheritance allows for code reuse and represents an \"is-a\" relationship. For example, in Java, a `Dog` class could inherit from an `Animal` class since a Dog \"is an\" Animal.\n",
    "   - Incorrect: Inheritance means duplicating code from one object to another. An example would be copying all properties from a `Cat` object to a `Dog` object.\n",
    "   - Incorrect: Inheritance allows one interface to inherit from multiple other interfaces. An example would be a `Human` class inheriting from both `Animal` and `Plant` classes.\n",
    "10) Can you explain the difference between SQL and NoSQL databases? When would you prefer to use one over the other?\n",
    "   - Correct: SQL databases are relational, use structured query language, and have a predefined schema. They're good for complex queries and ACID transactions. NoSQL databases can be document-based, key-value, wide-column, or graph. They're more flexible and scalable, making them good for hierarchical data storage, large data sets, and real-time applications.\n",
    "   - Correct: SQL databases are good when consistency is needed, and the data model is not going to change frequently. NoSQL databases are preferable when working with large volumes of data or when the data model can change over time.\n",
    "   - Incorrect: SQL databases are always better than NoSQL databases because SQL has a structured query language.\n",
    "   - Incorrect: NoSQL databases are used when you don't want to store data, while SQL databases are used when you want to store data.\n",
    "11) Can you explain how 'this' keyword works in JavaScript and how TypeScript might alter its behavior?\n",
    "   - Correct: In JavaScript, the value of `this` is determined by the calling context. For example, in an object method, `this` refers to the object. However, in TypeScript, you can use arrow functions, which capture the `this` value of the containing function.\n",
    "   - Correct: In JavaScript, `this` is dynamically scoped, meaning it depends on how a function is called. In TypeScript, as in other statically-typed languages, `this` in a function can be strictly typed to be an instance of a certain class.\n",
    "   - Incorrect: In JavaScript, `this` always refers to the global object (window in a browser).\n",
    "   - Incorrect: TypeScript ignores the `this` keyword and you can use it interchangeably with any variable.\n",
    "12) How would you handle asynchronous data fetching in React components? Can you explain the pros and cons of the different approaches?\n",
    "   - Correct: You can use the `useEffect` hook to fetch data asynchronously when the component mounts, and then store that data in state using the `useState` hook.\n",
    "   - Correct: You could use React Query or SWR libraries that provide hooks for data fetching and automatic caching, background updates, and synchronization.\n",
    "   - Incorrect: You can use the `render` method to fetch data synchronously and block the rendering until the data is available.\n",
    "   - Incorrect: You can fetch data in the constructor of a class component and set it directly to this.state without using `setState`.\n",
    "13) In a Next.js application, where are you allowed to access the 'window' object?\n",
    "   - Correct: You can access the `window` object in Next.js inside the `useEffect` hook, ensuring it's not called during server-side rendering where `window` is not defined.\n",
    "   - Correct: The `window` object is available on the client side. You can access it in lifecycle methods like `componentDidMount` or event handlers.\n",
    "   - Incorrect: You can access the `window` object directly in the `getInitialProps` method in Next.js.\n",
    "   - Incorrect: The `window` object is available both on the server side and client side in Next.js.\n",
    "14) How would you design an API endpoint to be idempotent? Why might this be important?\n",
    "   - Correct: An idempotent API endpoint is one that gives the same result no matter how many times the same request is made. PUT and DELETE HTTP methods should be idempotent - calling them multiple times shouldn't have different effects.\n",
    "   - Correct: To design an idempotent API endpoint, you should ensure that repeated requests with the same parameters yield the same result. A unique id can be used to identify each operation.\n",
    "   - Incorrect: POST requests are idempotent.\n",
    "   - Incorrect: An API endpoint that increments a counter each time it's called is idempotent.\n",
    "15) How would you model a many-to-many relationship in a relational database versus a NoSQL database?\n",
    "   - Correct: In a relational database, you would use a junction table to handle a many-to-many relationship. In a NoSQL database like MongoDB, you might embed an array of references in one document, or store a separate document for the relationship itself.\n",
    "   - Correct: In a SQL database, many-to-many relationships are typically handled using a join table. In NoSQL databases, you have more flexibility - you might use an array of foreign keys, nested objects, or even graph structures depending on the nature of the data and the database.\n",
    "   - Incorrect: In a relational database, you can handle a many-to-many relationship by adding an array of foreign keys to a table.\n",
    "   - Incorrect: In a NoSQL database, you handle a many-to-many relationship by creating a join table with foreign keys.\n",
    "16) How would you mock dependencies for unit tests in a JavaScript application?\n",
    "   - Correct: You can use libraries such as Jest or Sinon to stub or mock functions and modules. This allows you to isolate the functionality being tested.\n",
    "   - Correct: With Jest, you can use `jest.mock()` to automatically set up all functions of the module as jest mock functions. You can also use `jest.fn()` to create individual mock functions.\n",
    "   - Incorrect: You should change the actual code of the application to return specific results during testing.\n",
    "   - Incorrect: You don't need to mock dependencies in unit tests; instead, you should set up a full integration environment for each test run.\"\"\""
