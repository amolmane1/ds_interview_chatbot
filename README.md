# Take-home Data Science Challenge Chatbot

Most companies that hire Data Scientists have a take-home Data Challenge as part of their hiring process. 
Candidates are typically given a dataset and a task (usually to analyze the data and fit a model to achieve a certain goal), and then present their work to the hiring team in a 1 hr call, where the interviewers ask them questions about what they did and why.
This process is time-consuming for employers. I have created a chatbot that uses LLMs to automate this interview. 
It asks candidates questions about what they did, grades their answers, and based on the answers, figures out the next question to ask. It covers several topics (EDA, preprocessing, modeling, model evaluation, etc).
